##Best Practices for Apps and Authors

`##` or `###` text should start a new page and be centre-aligned if it starts a line

`@` or `####` text should be centre-aligned if it starts a line

`~~~` with a clear line above and below should be centre-aligned and can be formatted out as * * * if apps want to replicate publishing standards

New lines should be indented unless the first word is CAPITALISED

The first word of every chapter should therefore be CAPITALISED to prevent indentation

Apps should output to PDF, RTF, and EPUB file formats

Apps should work in and output to Goudy Bookletter 1911 font or a similar serif font.

When outputting to PDF, the first instance of `#` and `@` text should be placed in the heading of each page to display the book title and author(s) in the following format: BOOK TITLE â€” AUTHOR(S)

When outputting to PDF, page numbers should start from the page containing the first instance of `##` or `###` and be centre-aligned in the page footer
